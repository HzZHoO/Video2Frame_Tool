# Video2Frame_Tool
Simple tool to extract frames from videos.   
It has UI (user interface) and can convert all videos under a selected directory which must have pure English path.  
The UI is designed for Chinese users, but I think it's easy to convert it to English version.
**Note**:  
For a video with path `parent_dir/0000.mp4`, the frames of it will be write to directory `parent_dir/0000`

## 1.Run the tool!
```
python Video2Frames.py
```  

## 2.Select a directory containing videos

## 3.Input frame extraction step
Input an integer (between 1 and 1000) as the step for frame extraction.
By default, the step is 1.
