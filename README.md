# Video2Frame_Tool
Simple tool to extract frames from videos.   
It has UI (user interface) and can convert all videos under a selected directory which must have pure English path.  
The UI is designed for Chinese users, but I think it's easy to convert it to English version.  

## 1.Run the tool!
```
python Video2Frames.py
```  

## 2.Select a directory containing videos
